# Deployment & Feature Log: ATLAS v2.0

All meaningful changes to the ATLAS system are documented here, following the Zuckerberg/Anti-Vibe standard.

## [2026-02-22] - Feature Architecture & GitHub Baseline

### 🚀 What
- Established a clinical, feature-based directory structure (`auth`, `rbac`, `employee`, `md`, `shared`).
- Implemented **Type Bridging** for hyper-isolated `node_modules`, achieving 100% build success.
- Finalized Phase 1 & 2 pre-flight integrity checks (Lint, Typecheck, Build, Secret Scan).
- Successfully connected and pushed the verified baseline to **https://github.com/Aditya-Chavan-dev/ATLAS.git**.
- Cleaned all bootstrap boilerplate to provide a production-ready starting point.

### 💡 Why
- **Architecture**: Ensures 100% isolation of concerns from day one, preventing logic leakage.
- **Reliability**: Verified build pipes guarantee that the hyper-isolated setup is not just clean, but functional.
- **Alignment**: Direct synchronization with GitHub establishes the source of truth for all future "Zuckerberg Standard" sprints.
- **Hygiene**: Wiping bootstrap code prevents technical debt and keeps the focus purely on project-specific features.

## [2026-02-22] - Initial Project Foundation (Absolute Isolation)

### 🚀 What
- Established a hyper-isolated repository structure.
- Created `Setup/` directory as the exclusive hub for dependencies (`node_modules`), configurations (Vite, TypeScript), and build infrastructure.
- Isolated source code into `apps/web/src` and `packages/shared/src`, ensuring no setup clutter in source folders.
- Verified absolute isolation through remote typechecking and production builds from the `Setup/` context.
- Initialized Git repository with a robust `.gitignore` enforcing project cleanliness.

### 💡 Why
- **Cleanliness**: Ensures zero setup-to-root leakage, keeping the project easy to scan and maintain.
- **Scalability**: Centralized configuration allows for consistent builds across multiple potential apps and packages.
- **Security**: The isolated structure prevents accidental exposure of configuration or build artifacts in source-only environments.
- **Zuckerberg/Anti-Vibe Standard**: Prioritizes shipping a high-impact, professional-grade foundation with strictly enforced governance.
